Changes in SecureFX 6.6.1 (Official) -- November 4, 2010
--------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

    and rename was selected in the replace prompt, the specified
    rename file was not on the destination.
  - The session .INI-file-only option "Disable MLSX" was not being
    honored when it was on.

Changes in SecureFX 6.6 (Official) -- October 21, 2010
------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

    sent to the log file in addition to the synchronize view's log
    window.


Changes in SecureFX 6.6 (Beta 6) -- October 14, 2010
----------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - When connecting to a server through a SOCKS firewall, multiple
    username and password prompts were displayed and if they were
    cancelled, SecureFX crashed.
  - SecureFX could crash when key generation was cancelled and then
    the Key Generation Wizard was launched.
  - When many small files were being downloaded and "Cancel All" was
    selected, the local window appeared to be stuck in a refresh loop
    and CPU usage spiked.
  - If an upload was started and cancelled in a session that did not
    have a saved password, the session was disconnected and
    reconnected.
  - The position of ".." changed after sorting by Date Modified and
    changing directories.
  - While connected to a session displaying the tree view, after
    attempting to change to an invalid directory, the hierarchy was
    disabled.
  - The transfer queue context menu items were not in the correct
    state after "Cancel All" was selected and parallel transfers were
    in progress.


Changes in SecureFX 6.6 (Beta 5) -- September 30, 2010
------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - The following changes were made to log file output:
    - Status text for upload and download transfers changed from
      "Remote file closed." to "Source file closed." or "Destination
      file closed."
    - "Failed to close remote file." became "Failed to close
      destination file." or "Failed to close source file."

Bug fixes:

  - Resuming an interrupted folder transfer could put files in the
    wrong folder.
  - When SecureCRT was also installed, if the Global Options dialog
    was closed when the Terminal/Advanced category was active and the
    Global Options dialog was restarted, the active category was File
    Transfer/Options/Advanced.
  - If the transfer queue was enabled, the View menu showed that the
    transfer queue was disabled when a remote file was being edited.
  - SCP: If a file was edited remotely and saved, SecureFX crashed
    when attempting to upload it.
  - SFTP: If a file was edited remotely, when the file was saved and
    uploaded, the remote file did not have the correct timestamp.
  - SFTP: Duplicate messages were logged when transferring files.


Changes in SecureFX 6.6 (Beta 4) -- September 16, 2010
------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - The following changes were made to log file output:
    - All server-to-server "Skipping file transfer" messages are now
      tagged with "<src>" rather than "<dst>".
    - "Source path '<path>' does not exist.\n\nIt will be skipped."
      became "Failed to retrieve information on the source item
      (<path>).  It will be skipped."
    - "Failed to retrieve information on the source item.  It will be
      skipped." became "Failed to retrieve information on the source
      item (<path>).  It will be skipped."
    - "Checking remote directory status..." became "Checking
      destination directory status..."
    - "Reading remote site directory..." became "Reading source
      directory..."
    - "Reading local directory..." became "Reading source
      directory..."

Bug fixes:

  - SecureFX could crash during a "mirror both" synchronization
    operation if more than one directory at a time was being
    synchronized.
  - When connecting to an MVS server that sent characters other than
    decimal digits for the "Used" field, files could not be listed or
    downloaded.
  - Uploading failed when directory tree detection was disabled.
  - When multiple folders were transferred in parallel, if one of the
    transfers was cancelled, the next transfer started, but so did the
    previously cancelled transfer, which could no longer be cancelled.
  - When multiple files were transferred in parallel, if a file of
    unknown type was transferred and ASCII was specified to apply to
    all files of unknown type, it was only honored for the one file.
  - When an item in the transfer queue failed to transfer, it could
    prevent the queue from processing other items.
  - The "Choose Transfer Type" dialog was displayed multiple times for
    files with the same extension after specifying the transfer type
    to be used for all files.
  - When folders were transferred in parallel, if a file collision
    occurred, the overwrite prompt was displayed twice.


Changes in SecureFX 6.6 (Beta 3) -- August 31, 2010
---------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - When folders were transferred, a single file was transferred at a
    time regardless of the "Maximum number of parallel transfers"
    value.
  - If an attempt was made to create a new folder in a location where
    access was denied, SecureFX crashed.


Changes in SecureFX 6.6 (Beta 2) -- August 17, 2010
---------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - SSH2/SFTP/SCP: Socket write errors are now written to trace
    output.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureFX could crash when a synchronize operation caused files to
    be deleted on the local machine.
  - When files were being transferred in parallel, cancelling out of
    the Choose Transfer Type dialog caused the remaining files to get
    stuck at "Checking destination" and they could not be cancelled.
  - During synchronization, when the direction was Download, the local
    path was not displayed.
  - The color depth of some of the icons on the toolbar was reduced,
    which caused them to look pixelated.
  - SFXCL: When multiple files were transferred and a file transfer
    failed, the log reported that all files were transferred
    successfully.


Changes in SecureFX 6.6 (Beta 1) -- August 3, 2010
--------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Limit or "throttle" the bandwidth used during file transfers to
    keep from consuming all available bandwidth.
  - Specify the number of parallel file transfers and, as transfers
    are completed, queued files will continually fill available slots.
  - Selecting Download on remote files automatically places the files
    in the local CWD if a different download location has not been
    specified.
  - If a PASV data connection fails, SecureFX automatically tries to
    reconnect using the original host/IP address.
  - Added an Upload button that can be used for menu and toolbar
    customization.
  - The same file size display options that were previously available
    for the transfer window are now also available for the tree view.
  - SSL: Support for RFC 2228 Clear Command Channel (CCC) provides
    enhanced compatibility with SSL servers.
  - FTP/SSL: Available and negotiated SSL algorithms for implicit
    as well as explicit connections are now logged.
  - SFTP: Added the session INI-file-only option "Preferred SFTP
    Version" that forces SecureFX to use a specific SFTP version.
  - SSH2: Added support for the "null" host-key algorithm for GSS-KEX
    as specified in RFC 4462.
  - SFXCL: A password can be specified when using a session with
    SFXCL.
  - SFXCL: Added two new options to the /S switch.  The "TransferType"
    option allows the transfer type to be specified independently of
    the file type.  The "Attr" option allows the file type to be
    specified independently of the transfer type.

Changes:

  - When the "Trace Level" is set to 9, the password is automatically
    redacted from the trace output.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureFX could crash if a file was being edited or transferred and
    the remote connection was lost.
  - SecureFX crashed or hung if the transfer queue refreshed while
    renaming a previously transferred file.
  - If a saved synchronize session that used a session with no file
    transfer protocol specified was run, SecureFX crashed.
  - Files could not be uploaded to a directory that had write access,
    but not read access.
  - SecureFX failed to transfer multiple items in the transfer queue
    when the connection count was limited.
  - When a file was dragged into the queue, the file was not always
    transferred to the current working directory.
  - Direct server-to-server transfers did not update the time
    remaining and the throughput correctly.
  - If the last location in the local window was My Computer or My
    Network Places (Network Neighborhood), it was not restored when
    SecureFX was restarted.
  - Quick Connect sessions where the host was an IPv6 address could
    not be saved.
  - If a previously failed item in the transfer queue was re-queued in
    order to wait for a connection to become available, it could
    potentially get re-queued over and over and display a large number
    of failed transfer dialogs.
  - On Windows, when large font (120 DPI) was used, text on some
    dialogs was truncated.
  - FTP: If a file was downloaded to a local mapped drive, SecureFX
    reported that 0 bytes were downloaded, even though the file was
    not empty.
  - SFTP: When connection failed, socket-level errors were not
    reported or logged.
  - SFTP: Server-to-server transfers did not log all output for SFTP
    connections.
  - SFXCL: When attempting to authenticate using keyboard-interactive
    authentication and the password was specified in a URL or a
    session, there was a password prompt.
